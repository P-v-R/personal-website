**BUILT with React, React-Strap and Framer Motion**
**OVERVIEW**
Basic website portfolio to show to potential job prospects, if you are a potential job prospect reading this....hello! 
I built this app with a style and design in mind, keeping the layout simple and straying away from anything too visually 
over stimulating. I have a lot of things I would like to improve on this site but its passion project and will probably always be 
a work in progress, Adding some more API interaction outside of the "tell me a joke" section and possibly adding a blog section are 
some things i have on the horizon. 

**TODO**
 * clean up the structuring of the import statements and make sure they are all consistent across components 
 * ADD MORE TESTS! (always a goal of mine)
 * Compile all CSS files into a separate folder so its a little easier to navigate at a glance in the IDE
 * Add a blog function...
    1. This is a little more complex, I think I would want to build a backend to store the blog posts in a DB
    2. Building a BE and a database would naturally make me want to adjust how im currently storing my text assets and clean up that approach
